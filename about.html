                <h2>What are we?</h2>
                <p>We are a team of passionate students from Seekonk Middle School working on a genius hour project.

Currently, the scores and schedules for these sports are scattered across multiple websites, causing inconvenience and difficulty in accessing the information.</p>
                <p>We aim to address this problem by developing a platform that gathers all the scores and schedules in one single place. By doing so, we hope to make it easier for students, parents, and fans to stay updated and engaged with Seekonk High School's football games.</p>
